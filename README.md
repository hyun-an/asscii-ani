animate any youtube video you want in your terminal, i think

Make sure to install all dependencies: 
- Pillow
- cv2
- numpy

Steps for thingamajig
1. First put video in project folder and rename it "video_to_convert.py".
2. Run ``python3 converter.py``
3. Get fps info for the video and then run ``python3 assination.py``
4. Enter fps and voila, if the video is too large make sure to go into ``assination.py`` and change the loop from ``i<4000`` to a larger number

I made this project from a lot of random sources, please forgive the ugly code :)
