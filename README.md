animate any youtube video you want in your terminal, i think

DEPENDECIES:
Install the following for it to work well:
- cv2 << pip install cv2
- numpy << pip install numpy
- PIL (Pillow) <<  pip install Pillow

STEPS FOR IT TO WORK
1. download an mp4 of the badapple music video
2. run "converter.py" with the mp4 file in the same folder (name the video "badapple.mp4")
3. run "assinator.py"
>>make the terminal size 100x46

--btw this might not work cuz i suk at this, ill try to make it better later--
