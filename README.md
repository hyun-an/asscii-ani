animate any youtube video you want in your terminal, i think

STEPS FOR IT TO WORK
1. download an mp4 of the badapple music video
2. run "converter.py" with the mp4 file in the same folder (name the video "badapple.mp4")
3. run "assinator.py"

--btw this might not work cuz i suk at this, ill try to make it better later--
